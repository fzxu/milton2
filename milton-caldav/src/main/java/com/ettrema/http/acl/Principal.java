 * Marker interface to identify those classes which can act as a Principal. This can be a user or a group
 * 
 * An absolute minimum requirement for a Principal is to be able to identify it, and
 * this is represented by the sole method on this interface which is getIdentifier.
 * 
 * Note that some Principals are defined by the webdav protocol so must be subject
 * to explicit processing requirements. For this reason the principle identifier
 * is a structured type which can be associated with a namespace and well known
 * names within that namespace.
 * 
 *
 * There are 2 types of Principal
 *  - Discrete: identifies a particular resource, which might be a user or group. Users are always discrete, groups may be
 * physical resources in which case they are represented as discrete resources. But groups may also be dynamically evaluated..
 *  - DAV: a dynamically evaluated group as defined by the ACL spec. Eg the Authenticated group matches any user
 * with an authenticated request. A dynamically evaluated group defined by the protocol is not
 * a physical resource do does not have a corresponding href
